        <p>this is my new portfolio site because this is a serious thing.
            to be honest there is stuff about this that's interesting to document :)
            so here's some of that!</p>
        <h3>semantic html</h3>
        <p>i absolutely <em>love</em> the idea of the &lt;em&gt;/&lt;i&gt; 
            tags and &lt;strong&gt;/&lt;b&gt; tags being semantically different.
            very appealing to the semanticist autism, i love meaning :)</p>
        <h3>attribution</h3>
        <p>i did take the photo on <a href="./">the homepage</a> 
            from having
            <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/todaysbird/719251673619595264">
                    seen it in a meme</a>, 
            but then i feel like attribution is something people should try harder 
            at in situations (like this!) where it's possible. so thank you
